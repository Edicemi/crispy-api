#HI there!😁
😉#About ME

✌ My name is Taiwo Victoria and I am a software developer (specializing in Back End Development), but wonderfully I have a Bachelor Degree in Pure & Applied Botany😱.

✌ I enjoy tech and coding, I am always happy about learning new technology. In 2019, I started learing Python then later in 2020 I started using Django framework. Tho I started as a front
end developer, I really wanted to know more and now in 2021 I use Node JS(express).

✌ Outside the world of Tech, I love pushing myself to learn new skills, singing and also fashion designing. I also enjoy dancing to loud musics.

✌ I love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are Rich Dad Poor Dad and also Intentional Living. 
I don't like travelling and I still do wonder why.
